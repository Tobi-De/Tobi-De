## Hi, I'm Tobi! 👋🏾 👨🏿‍💻

Welcome to my github bio. I'm a software engineer, Python Software Foundation Fellow, working with [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/), [htmx](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx), [django](https://github.com/django/django), [fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and [python](https://github.com/python). I'm always fascinated when I come across well-structured and organized software code repositories. I sometimes find myself spending a stupid amount of time thinking about the right place to put a file or directory, name a variable, class, module, etc..., and I'm still not good at it :persevere:. I really enjoy watching tech conferences describing a well-designed distributed system that can scale to thousands or millions of users, the trials and failures it took to get there, always looking for those corny programmer jokes, ah delightful :laughing:. Some quick facts:

- 🔭 I’m currently learning golang
- 🌱 I plan to contribute as much as possible to open source this year (2022)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything python related
- 🔊 I love listening to Pop, Mordern Rock, J-pop, and many other kinds of music
